## Weekly Swing Trade Analysis - Week of [DD MMM YYYY]

### My Scanner (ChartInk - 52 Week Breakout with Volume)
I use a ChartInk scanner with these filters:

- Daily Volume > 1.5x 50-day average (volume confirmation)
- Daily Close > 200 SMA (long-term uptrend)
- Daily RSI between 55-75 (momentum, not overbought)
- EMA 20 > EMA 50 (short-term trend bullish)
- Market Cap > ₹1000 Cr (quality filter)
- Price > ₹100 (liquidity filter)
- Weekly Close > 1.02x last week close (weekly momentum)
